A Review of *I Who Have Never Known Men* by Jacqueline Harpman

[Previously published on my personal blog](https://chloexu.substack.com/p/reading-as-a-communal-activity)

I posted my [2025 reading list](https://chloexu.substack.com/p/my-2025-reading-list) this morning. Just hours after crafting this selection of 38 books, I decided to forgo it entirely and start my year by rereading *I Who Have Never Known Men* by Jacqueline Harpman.

I first came across this book in August of 2024. Upon finishing, I entered a stage of brief catatonic shock. Then, I came close to tears, saved it in my collection of “favorites,” and gave it a perfect five-star rating.

I raved about the novel to my sister with such verve that she downloaded it. Before she had a chance to begin reading, she was waylaid by the new picks for her book club. She was reading one such book, a lengthy memoir that had given her a headache, when I recommended that she take a break and read *I Who Have Never Known Men*. It is a short novel with fewer than 200 pages.

As she read, I peered over her shoulder. I quickly turned from vigilant overseer to invested reader. She moved the device to lie between us so I no longer needed to crane my neck.

Consumption of books differs from consumption of other media in that reading is not a fundamentally communal activity. This was the first time either of us had read the same book at the same time. Frankly, I told her that this was a book best digested alone, but I was happy to read it alongside her and bring some levity to the (otherwise emotionally destructive) experience.

*I Who Have Never Known Men* is a small, sacred story. It centers around a young girl called “the child” by her fellow inmates. For an unknown number of years, she is stuck in a prison with thirty-nine other women who have no knowledge of how they came to be in this situation. They are tormented by the unspeakable losses of their previous lives.

This book should be read with little prior knowledge. My sister initially expected *I Who Have Never Known Men* to be a feminist novel like *The Handmaid’s Tale*, and she was pleasantly surprised by this post-apocalyptic narrative. *I Who Have Never Known Men* is riveting in its suspense. Even during a reread, my emotions swung with the narrator’s unmistakably human propensity towards experiencing love, loneliness, and remorse despite her claims of not being “fully human.”

She frequently talks about excretion, menstruation, and assisted suicide. She mentions the names of the other women’s children. Their coping mechanisms. A remembrance so painful that it necessitates the act of letting go—and then, the accompanying guilt. The novel reads like an intimate confession. Despite its brevity, it manages to encapsulate the human condition.

The planet in the novel is consistently bleak, depressing, and hopeless. Yet there remains the demand for answers, an insatiable curiosity. There remains the desire to stake a claim to the whole world, to have power, to withhold secrets. To seek companionship—to find connection even in its barest forms, in the elusive tether between the reader and the narrator. To grapple with death. What does it mean to have been alive when you are no longer living? To be delusional in optimism. To adapt, to explore, to settle, to be brave.

I am happy to report that this book is absolutely worth a second read. In fact, today I drew two conclusions that I hadn’t initially stumbled upon.

The beginning of the novel establishes the power dynamic between the narrator and the other women. From the narrator’s perspective, the women withhold information because they want to maintain an imitation of power:

“Did they only keep me in ignorance so they could pretend they weren't entirely powerless? I’d realized that I was as strong as they were and that not confiding a secret, which is within everyone's grasp so long as there is no torture, immediately makes the secret seem infinitely precious.”

Similarly, we finish the book without having received an explanation for the apparent near-extinction of humanity. This alien world is forgiving in its inoffensive weather and terrain. It derives all of its power from its withheld secrets; it is only foreboding because it is unknown.

By the end of the novel, we are still deprived of any answers. Rather than being disappointing, the conclusion reinforces the power of this world via its uncountable mysteries. This was a planet worthy of the women’s unrelenting search; this was a planet appropriate for their wonder.

Ultimately, if the narrator had discovered the answers to all of her questions, would she have told us, or would she have kept that power for herself? The confidence with which we can answer this question by the end of the novel is a testament to the story’s efficacy. It is evident that her yearning for connection eventually grows to outweigh her concerns about power dynamics.
Secondly, I have reconsidered my categorization of *I Who Have Never Known Men* as a book to be enjoyed alone.

The narrator repeatedly mentions “some unknown reader who will probably never come” with the same self-aware air as her other unfounded hopes. I felt the urge to grab her through the pages, screaming that I am that unknown reader and none of their lives have been forgotten. Despite the intimacy of the story, I was compelled to share it and cement the realness of the narrator, whose story is “as important as that of King Lear or of Prince Hamlet that William Shakespeare had taken the trouble to relate in detail.”

While my sister and I read, we interjected, theorized, sought each other for comfort, and grew somber as we realized the trajectory of the narrative. But we also laughed. We laughed as the narrator “passed a motion” (pooped) and “erupted” while fantasizing about a young guard. In the midst of the story’s darkness, my sister and I had each other; we had laughter.

At the end of her life, the narrator considers whether she laughed authentically—the others did—and cannot remember. This, among everything, stands out to me as one of her greatest regrets: not having laughed unabashedly.

I leave you with this passage, which has since evolved into one of my greatest influences:

“The briefest conversation creates time. Perhaps I have tried to create time through writing these pages. I begin, I fill them with words, I pile them up, and I still don't exist because nobody is reading them. I am writing them for some unknown reader who will probably never come - I am not even sure that humanity has survived that mysterious event that governed my life. But if that person comes, they will read them and I will have a time in their mind. They will have my thoughts in them. The reader and I thus mingled will constitute something living, that will not be me, because I will be dead, and will not be that person as they were before reading, because my story, added to their mind, will then become part of their thinking. I will only be truly dead if nobody ever comes, if the centuries, then the millennia go by for so long that this planet, which I no longer believe is Earth, no longer exists. As long as the sheets of paper covered in my handwriting lie on this table, I can become a reality in someone's mind. Then everything will be obliterated, the suns will burn out and I will disappear like the universe.”
